State actions should *never* include waits! This could make the state indeterminate as it could progress past the ISR call and it would be undetermined behavior on whether it should proceed with its instructions or restart. Instead refer to the diagram on [[3.13 Choosing a period for different time intervals]] that shows a looping system at the hardware clock. This would still allow ISR interrupts. It can also be seen on [[3.15 Converting a SynchSM to C]] in a code implementation. This process of writing out code that runs without a 'sleep' but still accounts for time is called a '**run to completion**' model.

That being said we should avoid waiting for anything including user input! This could block ISR calls as well.
