Time ordered behavior is defined as functionality that depends on the order of outputs. An example of this is an automatic door. The sensor detects someone approaching and closes when it detects them on the second sensor inside a specific distance away. This order of events makes the system a time ordered behavior.

Time ordered behaviors can be written in C but become difficult to understand for embedded developers with increased complexity. Consider the function below that has two holding patterns and increments when a full cycle is completed. This is the carousel example. Every time the sensor makes contact with the point on the carousel it pulses 1 on A0 which is used in the holding patterns seen in the coding example.

```C
#include "RIMS.h" 

void main() {
	B = 0; 
	while (1) {
		while (!A0);
		B = B + 1; 
		while (A0); 
	} 
}
```

There are two major groups to define a function. It can be time-ordered or data-processing.

C has trouble with time-ordered processes because it's a sequential instruction computation model instead of a object oriented model. 

Now let's expand the functionality of the C based carousel with a reset button on A1.

```C
#include "RIMS.h"

void main()
{
   B = 0;
   while (1) { 
      while (!A1 && !A0);
      if (A1) {
          B = 0; // Reset
      }
      else {
          B = B + 1;
          while (A0);
      }
   }
}
```

The complexity of this is growing un-readable.

They didn't include an example of a C++ based alternative but I am challenging myself to make one that reduces the complexity.

```C++
class CarouselSys{
	public bool STATE;
	public bool RESET;
	public int count = 0;
	
	public CarouselSys(char sensor, char reset){
		this.STATE = sensor;
		this.RESET = reset;
	}
	
	public void run(){
		while(!STATE && !RESET);
		if (STATE){
			this.incriment();
			this.wait(STATE)
		} else {
			this.reset();
		}
	}
	
	private void wait(char input) {
		if(input){
			while(!input);
		} else {
			while(input);
		}
	}
	
	public void reset(){
		this.count = 0;
	}
	
	private void incriment(){
		this.count++;
	}
}

void main() {
	CarouselSys carouselSys = new CarouselSys(A0, A1);
	carouselSys.run();
}
```

There is more to it. It's mostly wraps for readability and helper functions. The important thing is that it's easier to read.
