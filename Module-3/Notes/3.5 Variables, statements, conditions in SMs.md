It's best practice to always create a state that initializes the variables used. You could initialize them before they even reach the state section but keeping your initializing values together is important. This allows us to re-initialize as needed in an embedded system such as a system failure. You should still define the variables on a global level to ensure that every function can utilize them.

Its best practice that any waiting/holding pattern should be taken as a transition.
