It's important to create a robust set of testing inputs for an SM. These various input combinations are called a **test vector**. 

Testing for a time-ordered behavior may consists of:
1) Determine the cases to test which should include a mix of normal cases and edge cases.
2) Determine a sequence of test vectors to test each scenario.

Consider the following SM for an emergency door.

The following would be a good start of test vectors.

|     | Scenario                                                              | Expected Final State | Expected Output (B0) | Test Vectors (A1A0) |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| 1   | (Init): _Alarm should not sound._                                     | Unarmed              | 0                    | 00                  |
| 2   | (Unarmed): Arm system: _Alarm should not sound._                      | Armed                | 0                    | 01                  |
| 3   | (Armed) Open door. Alarm should sound.                                | Alarm                | 1                    | 11                  |
| 4   | (Alarm): Unarm: Alarm should stop.                                    | Unarmed              | 0                    | 10                  |
| 5   | (Unarmed): Arm, open door, close door. Alarm should continue to sound | Alarm                | 1                    | 00, 01, 11, 01      |
| 6   | (Alarm): Unarm, arm, unarm: Alarm should not sound.                   | Unarmed              | 0                    | 00, 01, 00          |

When testing the SM we can enact the two major testing methodologies which are **white-box** and **black-box** testing. White-box testing is the act of testing individual sections of code or testing with considerations of knowing the code base. Black-box testing on the other hand is testing exclusively with just the input and output sections of a program without any considerations of the internal workings.
