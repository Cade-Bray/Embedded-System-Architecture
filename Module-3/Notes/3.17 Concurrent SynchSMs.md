Most systems don't just have one set of instructions for a single LED. Usually a system has to control multiple outputs at the same time. These groups of instructions are called a **task**. Each task can run concurrently with other tasks. Each task is its own SynchSM typically. To diagram this behavior of concurrent tasks we use a model called a block diagram as seen as an example below.

You can see the block diagram is called '`LedShow`' while each task is its own synchSM. Technically speaking these each synchSM has its own timer period that can use the ISR but there is a small non-zero period of time between these synchSM executions because its unlikely you have a dedicated thread for every task.
