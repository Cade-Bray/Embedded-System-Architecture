`RIBS` stands for Riverside-Irvine Builder of state machines. It's a graphical user interface that enables engineers to capture diagrams of SMs. 

This wasn't really a module to learn off of beyond just learning the absolute basics of how to use RIBS that is embedded in the zyBooks site. I can export the that and save it here to be used at a later time.
