SMs can be extended to support time-interval behavior as described in [[3.10 Time-interval behavior]]. An SM tick is assumed to a be a non-negative non-zero value. The **tick rate** can instead be set to a specific rate of time such as 500ms. An SM with a specific period as described is called a synchronous SM or synchSM for short. 

Entering a state causes immediate execution of its actions nearly every time. During a tick where a specific amount of time is defined we cannot execute code or change variable states while that code executes. That means during the waiting period nothing is actively changing in the system.

Consider the following SynchSM for a festive lights controller as an example.
