This section is a step by step guide to building an SM. The example below is building what is called and emergency door exit system. Basic States.

#### Step 1 is to list the system's basic states, adding actions if known:

#### Step 2 is to add transitions to each state to achieve the desired behavior

#### Step 3 is to mentally check the behavior of the captured SM

- This step may result in adding more transitions, or even more states.
- We should check that exactly one transition's condition will be true.
- We should also determine whether the SM's behavior is as desired, by mentally executing the SM and thinking what input sequences might occur. 
- We consider the possibility that a user might want to disarm the system while armed, and notice that is not possible in the SM. Thus, we may add transitions, such as !A0 from Armed to Unarmed.

Capturing time-ordered behavior is hard. Good designers will spend much time mentally executing their SM and thinking of possible input sequences that need to be addressed. Refining an SM many times is commonplace.
