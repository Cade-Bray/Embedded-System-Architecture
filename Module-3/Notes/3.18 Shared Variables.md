It's common for intercommunication between synchSM's by using global variables. It's just important to remember not to wait for a global variable to update in a state because this makes the synchSM indeterminate as described in [[3.16 State actions should never wait]]. Instead the synchSM can be constantly updating at its interval searching for an update. 

Its best practice to avoid issues that only one SynchSM can write to a global. This ensures that no confliction of processes occurs. Additionally, since all the other tasks are unsure when a process may update a global we should mark that global as volatile. This ensures the compiler doesn't abstract the functionality away.

 A common error is to not ensure that tasks communicate robustly, leading to a system that may sometimes work, but sometimes fails depending on the variations that can occur with "simultaneous" ticks.
