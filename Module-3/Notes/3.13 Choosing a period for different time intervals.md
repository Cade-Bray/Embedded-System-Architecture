You're not always going to have a system that has one time interval to build around. Imagine the scenario where a light stays on for 500ms and stays off for 1s. What interval would you choose to diagram your system as?

The answer is to choose the **greatest common divisor** or **GCD** of the required time intervals and then use multiple states to represent the programs needs. So in the scenario above the GCD is 500ms. 

It can be very helpful to use a counter system to ensure that you're keeping to a specific time requirement. Observe the example below where the LED is to be on for 750ms and the LED off for 5s. We're using a interval period of 250ms. The LED on state has a holding pattern that keeps it there for three iterations to make a rotation of 750ms.
