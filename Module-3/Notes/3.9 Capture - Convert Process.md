Capture convert is one of the most important concepts in disciplined programming in embedded systems. Starting with capture we gather the desired behavior using an appropriate computation model such as SMs. Following the capture step is the convert step. Convert the captured behavior to run on the available implementation platform such as C running on RIM. 

Even when tools like RIBS are not available its important to capture time-ordered behavior as an SM. You can even draw an SM on paper first. All modifications to a process should first go through updating the SM first before converting back to a C program. It can be difficult to think of the program in terms of a state machine instead of just the actual C program.

You may even need to reverse engineer a C based program back into an SM state diagram. There are many forms of state machine models beyond the SM model. One popular industry model is the UML state machine. Another popular model is dataflow models which are very well suited with dealing with digital signal processing applications.

When you're not dealing with a time-ordered behavior a SM state diagram isn't needed. You can instead capture requirements and functionality in anyway needed before moving directly to implementation in C.
